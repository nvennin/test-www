## PROCEDURE
A CAPA shall be focused on resolving the identified issue and preventing recurrence. The activities identified within the CAPA shall consider the risk of recurrence of the issue and the impact it may have. Timelines for completion of actions should be commensurate with the risk and impact of the identified issue recurring. The identiﬁed CAPA shall be aligned with the identified root cause that is under remediation.

### CAPA Initiation
* Once a CAPA is identified and agreed, between the originator and the CAPA ownerthe originator requests a CAPA number and CAPA form from Quality.
* Quality log the CAPA into the CAPA Tracking Register, assigning a number to the CAPA in the format CAPA-XXX-YYYY where XXX is a sequential number starting from 001 and YYYY represents the year.
* The originator records the CAPA number on CAPA Form, the category of the CAPA within the QMS, the date on which the CAPA was raised, the person initiating the CAPA and details of the reason for raising the CAPA.
* The potential impact of the proposed CAPA on other system/processes/procedures to avoid adverse impact in the future is assessed and recorded.
* Originator indicates the CAPA owner in consulation with Quality and the proposed owner. The CAPA details, action owner and due date for action completion are recorded on the form bythe originator.
* The originator signs the form as ”Prepared by” and then provides it to the Quality Manager at Theramex, as appropriate, who signs the form to indicate approval of the CAPAs, prior to their implementation. If the Quaiity Manager is not satisfied with the CAPA content, the form is returned to the originator for further work on the CAPA.

### CAPA Execution/Implementation 
* The CAPA owner is responsible for ensuring that the CAPA is executed and completed by the agreed due date.
* The CAPA owner shall complete CAPA actions by describing and referencing evidence of completion of the CAPA. Quality Manager/ RP has to verify that the action was completed appropriately and that the CAPA may proceed to closure. The requirement to perform a review of effectiveness of the CAPA is assessed by the Quality Manager/RP. 
* Quality update the CAPA register accordingly.

### CAPA Extension
* If, for any reason, the CAPA cannot be completed by the initially assigned due date, an extension shall be requested by the CAPA owner prior to the due date. Approval for the extension is granted by the Quality Manager. If a second extension is required, the Head of Quality must grant this approval with a detailed justification for same. A maximum of 2 extensions are allowed.  
* The Quality Manager/RP reviews the rationale for the requested extension and either accepts or rejects the proposal.
* If the extension is granted, Quality shall update the CAPA register.
* The CAPA owner proceeds with implementation of the CAPA by the new due date.

### CAPA Close-Out
* Once the CAPA has been completed and approved, the CAPA may be closed by Quality. 
* The signed hard copy of the closed CAPA is held on file.

### CAPA Review and Effectiveness Checks
* CAPA Form is used to record the review of effectiveness of each CAPA.
* If the result of the Effectivenss check does not meet the acceptance criteria then it needs to be assessed if the CAPA was not effective due to inadequate implementation or if the investigation needs to be re—opened to determine if the root cause or corrective actions were incorrectdly identified. 
* Quality shall perform a review of CAPAs, with the Quality Manager and/or RP as appropriate, including:
  * Summary details of open CAPAs and CAPAs that were closed since the last review
  * Evaluation of completed CAPAs to determine if the identified issue was successfully resolved/mitigated. If the review shows that the CAPA was not effective in mitigating or correcting the issue, a new CAPA shall be initiated. The new CAPA shall include a review of any impact relating to the lack of effectiveness.
* Quality shall present this summary status overview at routine Quality management review meetings.

## PROCEDURE

A CAPA shall be focused on resolving the identified issue and preventing recurrence.

* Quality reviews the CAPA suggestion and validates it as confiremed or dismisses it and closes the issue.
* The potential impact of the proposed CAPA on other system/processes/procedures to avoid adverse impact in the future is assessed by quality using the GitHub issue commenting feature.
* The Originator, Quality, and the Owner agree on an actions schedule, with due dates and action owners through the comments feature of GitHub Issues

### Execution and close-out

* The Owner is responsible for ensuring that the CAPA is executed and completed by the agreed due date.
* The Owner shall complete CAPA actions by describing and referencing evidence of completion of the CAPA.
* Reviewer verifies that the actions have been completed appropriately and proceeds to close the CAPA (by closing the GitHub Issue).

### Review and Effectiveness Checks

* Quality shall review CAPAs effeciveness and present this summary status overview at [Quality Management Review][OZCFN] meetings.

## Procedure

### Management of Third Party distribution providers

* A Quality Agreement must be in place with all Third Parties to ensure all transportation activities comply with GDP.
* Simple Pharma owns none of its own vehicles, and all transportation is outsourced. Third Party providers are subject to the checks and audits outlined in [Outsourced activities][HBQIN].
* As part of the qualification process, bona fide checks are performed on the Third Party storage and distribution sites to ensure they are appropriately authorised to receive and distribute the categories of products required.

### Transport routes and conditions

* Simple Pharma products (medicinal or otherwise) must be transported in accordance with registered storage conditions and label claim.
* Transport routes and distribution providers are selected with the support of the Responsible Person, through risk assessment, to minimise exposure to conditions that may compromise the quality, safety, efficacy or integrity of the products.
* Third Party storage and distribution sites are audited on their ability to record and validate transportation routes that minimise the exposure to conditions described above. Where possible, supply chain maps will be reviewed and evaluated as part of the audit process.
* Risk assessments should be performed by Quality with the Responsible Person to determine segments in the transportation routes where temperature controls should be put in place, taking seasonal variations into consideration. <em>An example of such a control would be transporting a cold chain product in a validated temperature-controlled container that is actively monitored</em>.

### Transportation

* Simple Pharma owns none of its own vehicles, and all transportation is outsourced through Third Party distribution providers or via their approved subcontractors.
* There must be sufficient capacity to allow orderly storage of the various categories of medicinal products during transportation and prevent breakage, damage or cross-contamination during transport.
* Shipping containers must provide secure protection during transport to prevent theft or falsified medicine entering the supply chain
* Vehicle operation, inspection, maintenance, validation and cleanliness is the responsibility of the Third Party Distributor / logistics provider. These responsibilities are detailed in the Quality Agreement with the outsourced provider of services.
* Transportation of medicinal products is to be accompanied with appropriate data loggers to record the temperature profile during shipment. Where Simple Pharma is responsible for inbound shipments of goods from contract manufacturing organisations, data loggers are provided by Simple Pharma to be loaded into the container during shipment according to the Quality Agreements with the Third Parties involved. The data loggers are to be validated by Simple Pharma and calibration certificates obtained.
* Transportation of medicinal products must take place in qualified temperature-controlled or temperature-monitored vehicles with containers equipped with the necessary continuous temperature logging device(s).
* Transportation and distribution of medicinal products must only be undertaken after the receipt of a valid delovery order or purchase order.
* Drivers must be trained in GDP and be made aware of the required conditions for transport and storage of medicinal products in transit. This should be detailed in the Quality Agreement with Third Party storage and distribution sites to ensure that drivers are trained in the relevant GDP practices. 
* Deliveries are made to the address stated on the delivery note and into the care of premises of the. Medicinal products must not be left on alternative premises.

**Note:** Where transportation hubs are utilises in the supply chain, medicinal products should be stored for no longer than the local regulatory authority recommends. For example, the HPRA state that if the products are stored in a hub for more than 48 hours, the hub  requires a wholesale licence. 

* If cold chain products are stored at a hub for any period of time, then the storage hub will require a wholesale licence.
* Distribution records must have the necessary information documented to ensure traceability and facilitate recalls where required. This should include, but is not limited to:
  - Date of dispatch
  - Name and address of the customer
  - Product name and quantity shipped
  - Batch number and expiry date
  - Business name and origin address, type of entity responsible for the transportation, contact number
  - Business name and destination address, status of the recipient (e.g. wholesaler, pharmacy)
  - Applicable transport and storage conditions
  - A unique identification number that can be used to identify the order
  
### Temperature Excursions

* Third Party providers responsible for the transportation of medicinal products ensure shipments are temperature monitired in accordance with Quality Agreements.
* Temperature data is taken into account when reviewing the criteria needed for release of saleable stock as detailed in [Receipt Of Medicinal Products][VQICE].
* Third Party providers responsible for the transportation of medicinal products notify Simple Pharma's Responsible Person in the event of a temperature excursion.
* When the temperature excursion is under review by the Responsible Person, the goods are quarantined and the Third Party provider is notified and instructed to replicate the quarantine status of the medicinal products affected.
* The releasing Qualified Person is notified of the temperature excursion by Quality where appropriate to determine, based on the investigation, the impact to the quality of the batch in question and whether the batch should be released into saleable stock.
* Where needed, the customer is notified

### Complaints

* Customer complaints arising from distribution activities are managed by Quality
* When a complaint is deemed 'serious'by the Quality Supervisor, the complaint is logged (e.g. as a GitHub issue). Complaints must be investigated to determine root cause, impact to other batches and a CAPA put in place where required.

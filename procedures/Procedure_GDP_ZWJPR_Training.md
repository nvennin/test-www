  * “Instructor Lead", where users will undertake more in—depth training, either face to face or electronically and will be required to undertake an assessment to verify effectiveness of training. This is always required for the PV awareness and GxP training.
* The level of training required for each procedure is captured under section 6 ’Training' of the procedure.

### Documentation of Training
* For instructor lead training attendance is captured on Training Attendance Record (TAR) or by a certificate produced by the instructor.
  * Where the training has been delivered as a WebEx the TAR may be used to capture attendance however it may not be possible to obtain the signature of all attendees. The trainer should seek confirmation of attendance through another means i.e. email.
  * For Read and Understand training the signed record as per Appendix 2 is evidence of training to be retained in the individuals training record.
  * Where individuals do not have access to a printer/scanner to apply their wet signature to the record an email confirming that the individual has read and understood the target document will be accepted. This email will be retained as evidence of training in the individuals training record.
  * The Training Record (Appendix 2) must be incorporated as the last page of the procedure or made available with the approved procedure where read and understood training is indicated.
* An individual who has authored or approved the document or training material will be identified as trained on the subject procedure or training material.
* The signed training records, or email confirmation where no printer/scanner available, are considered the primary record of training.

### Communication of Training Requirements
* The document author will confirm to Quality which functional groups, or individuals, are required to complete training on the target procedure who shall reflect the instruction in the Training Matrix.

## PROCEDURE

### Artwork Update Process

* An artwork change request is formulated through a GitHub Issue that details the change and its reasons, following the template artwork change request. The issue is labelled 'ARTWORK CHANGE REQUEST".
* A Regulatory Reviewer will review the proposed changes and formulates comments.
* Planning if informed of the change so that it can inform the manufacturing site of the change
* Artowrk Manager coordinates the execution of the changes with the artwork studio.
* Once the new version of the artwork is available a notification is sent to Regulatory Affairs advising that the artwork is available for review and approval.
* The artwork index entry for the older artwork is updated with a deprecation date

### Artwork Review and Approval Responsibilities

1. Regulatory Affairs review
   * Regulatory Affairs is responsible for all regulated content (text,tables, blue box info etc). Regulatory Affairs approval confirms the artwork is in compliance with legal labelling regulations and the approved MA license.
   * The Regulatory Reviewer reviews the artwork using the checklist included in the template artwork change request.
2. Health Authority review (if applicable)
   * Artworks are then  be submitted to the Health Authority if required.
   * If the HA rejects or requests changes, this will be annotated in the GitHub issues by the Regulatory Reviewer. A new version will be created, which will need to be approved internally before being resubmitted to the Health Authority for approval again.
3. Proofing at CMO
   * Once HA approval is granted or Regulatory approval is given (where no HA submission is required), or earlier if the business requests it, the Artwork Studio will prepare artwork package and send to the CMO for printer proofs to be created.
   * When proofs are received from the CMO they checked against the approved artwork to ensure they conform
4. Update of records
   * After steps 1, 2 and 3 have been validated, the artwork index is updated with the new artwork and its applicability date

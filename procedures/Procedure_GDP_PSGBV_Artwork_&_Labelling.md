## PROCEDURE

### Artwork Update Process
* An approved change request must be available indicating that an artwork change is required and approved by the business. An action to initiate an ACRF will be included for Regulatory Affairs
* Regulatory Affairs will complete all mandatory fields as required and send the ACRF to the Artwork & Labelling Department for approval. The ACRF must be sent with annotated pdfs or labelling text to indicate required changes.
* Artwork & Labelling department reviews the ACRF and assigns an Artwork Project Number.
* Artwork & Labelling department updates master labelling text and local labelling text.
* Artwork & Labelling department send the ACRF to the Planning department. Planning input the manufacturing site and the date of the next planned production. The planner will then return form to the Artwork & Labelling department.
* Artwork & Labelling department completes the ACRF, prints and signs.
* The approved ACRF and all annotated pdfs/updated labelling text are sent to the Artwork Studio as notification of required update.
* Artwork Studio creates a new project in the EAMS and upload new version of the artwork.
* Once the new version of the artwork is available a notification is sent to Regulatory Affairs advising that the artwork is available for review and approval.

### Artwork Review and Approval Responsibilities
* Regulatory Affairs is responsible for all regulated content (text,tables, blue box info etc). Regulatory Affairs approval confirms the artwork is in compliance with legal labelling regulations and the approved MA license.
* The nominated Regulatory Affairs reviewer reviews the artwork mock up on EAMS. The checklist is used as a guidance to ensure that all aspects of the artwork are reviewed.
* RA annotate any required changes in the EAMS for action by the Artwork Studio. Once amendment made the artwork is sent to the RA for review until approved.
* Upon approval of the artwork, the nominated Regulatory Affairs reviewer uploads the completed ARC to the EAMS as a record that all actions have been completed in advance of approval being granted.
* Once approved, artwork can be submitted to the Health Authority (if required).
* Once HA approval is granted or Regulatory approval is given (where no HA submission is required) the Artwork Studio will prepare artwork package and send to the CMO for printer proofs to be created.
* If the HA rejects or requests changes, this will be annotated by the nominated Regulatory Affairs reviewer. A new version will be created, this will need to be approved internally before being reâ€” submitted to the Health Authority for approval again.
* When proofs are received from the CMO they are sent to Regulatory Affairs/Artwork & Labelling Department to verify that no changes, from the approved artwork, have been made to regulated content.

### Implementation Strategy
* Artwork coordinates the implementation strategy for the new artwork in consultation with Planning and Regulatory based on the information provided in the ACRF.

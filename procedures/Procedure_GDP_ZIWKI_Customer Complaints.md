### Customer complaint Receipt
* Customer complaints can be received from all sources which can include:

* When Customer complaints are received via the approved call centre, the call centre will process all Customer complaints received.
* Customer complaints that are not received via the approved call centre must be forwarded to Quality Manager who will then forward these to the approved call centre.

### Customer complaint Logging
* All new complaints must be logged within 1 business day of receipt.
* A unique sequential number is assigned to each new customer complaint, in the format PQC-YYYY-XXXX, where YYYY is the year in which the complaint was received and XXXX is a sequential number starting at 0001. 
* To ensure GDPR compliance, patient details will not be provided to the pharma company. Only the approved call centre will hold patient data e.g. name and contact information.

### PQC Initiation
* Each new customer complaint must be initiated and the minimum information required to initiate complaint investigation is:
  * Product name
  * Batch number and expiry date should be recorded, where available
  * Complaint description
  * Availability of complaint sample or photos
* If a complaint is considered minor in nature, only one follow up attempt will be made by the call centre. In the case of a major or critical complaint, up to five attempts to gather the additional required information from the complainant can be made.
* A deviation is initiated based on identification of a trend as per Deviations. A trend is identified if three or more complaints are received in the last 12 months for :
  * the same batch
  * same reason for same product / device / API

### Customer complaints Classification

|Level       |Classification                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Invalid     |An event in which the complainant reported a potential product quality complaint but upon assessment of the information reported, a decision was made that there was insufficient information to suggest a product quality issue.                               
|Minor       |A product quality complaint that is not likely to pose a significant hazard to health.                                     
|Major       |A product quality complaint which could potentially cause illness or mistreatment but is not critical.                     
|Critical    |A product quality complaint that is potentially life threatening or could pose a serious risk to patient health.           

### Invalid Customer Complaints
* Invalid Customer Complaints can be closed upon initial classification once the classification has been confirmed and justification for invalidation has been provided.
* The call centre must be notified that the Customer Complaint has been classified as invalid.

### Customer Complaint Acknowledgement
* A target closure time of 45 days from date of receipt is set for all complaints.

### Customer Complaint Investigation
* If additional information is received at any time during a Customer Complaint investigation that impacts the criticality of a product complaint, the Customer Complaint must be re-classified and appropriate steps taken to support the reason for reâ€”classification (place stock on hold, expedite final investigation, report quality defect to regulatory authorities, recall, continuity of market supply, closure of Customer Complaint).
* If an investigation concludes that market action is warranted, refer to Recall Procedure to Authorities. If an investigation indicates the product is a suspected falsified medicine, refer to Falsified Medicinal Products.
* Confirm if the Customer Complaint was "Confirmed" or "Non-Confirmed" and document on Customer Complaint Form. There are four mechanisms by which a Customer Complaint can be considered as "Confirmed" :
  * The physical investigation/evaluation of a returned complaint sample.
  * The investigation of a photograph or other independent data regarding the alleged defect.
  * The identification of process conditions likely to have given rise to the complaint from reviews of the batch record and associated documentation and data.
  * The identification of similar defects in the retained samples.
* On completion of investigation review a final classification is assigned to the Customer Complaint and documented on the Customer Complaint Form.

### PQC Closure
* A final review is performed of the complaint form and all associated attachments. Complaint form is signed as closed by the Quality Manager and the tracker updated accordingly.
* The Customer Complaint Form is printed, signed and filed.

### Cancelled Complaints
In instances where Customer Complaints are initiated but it is subsequently determined that they do not require further processing these can be cancelled on the Customer Complaint tracker. The Customer Complaint Form is not required to be completed if it has not been initiated at the time of cancellation. 

### Product Replacement / Reimbursement
It is the responsibility of the Commercial Manager in each country to facilitate the product replacement or product reimbursement process. 

### Quarterly Review
A quarterly review of Customer Complaints will be performed by Quality as part of the quality management review.

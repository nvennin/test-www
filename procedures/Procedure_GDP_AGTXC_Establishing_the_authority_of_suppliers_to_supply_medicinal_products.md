## PROCEDURE

### Establishing Bona Fides of Suppliers and Customers

#### General Requirements for Suppliers
* A new supplier is evaluated by Quality in accordance with [Outsourced Activities][HBQIN].
* The qualification process for a new supplier includes confirming that the supplier is appropriately authorised to supply the requested products to the markets in question.
  * If the supply of the medicinal product is directly from a manufacturer or packager, they must have a Manufacturing and Importation Authorisation MIA or local Regulatory Authority equivalent listing the specific product type.
  * If the product is being received from a wholesaler or distribution centre, they must hold a WDA or local Regulatory Authority equivalent listing the product type.
* The period of authorisation/certification is checked to ensure it is valid. Bona fide checks will be reconfirmed on an annual basis. 
* All sources used to verify supplier authorisations must be official sources such as Regulatory Authority or Health Board websites.

#### General Requirements for Customers
* The qualification process for a new customer includes confirming that the customer is appropriately authorised to receive the category of product in question.
* The company name and destination address as provided by the customer who is placing the order is verified as corresponding with details on authorisation documentation. The 'Bill To' address is verified if different from the 'Ship To' address. Confirm the address details correspond with input on the system. Addresses for both billing and shipping address need to be checked.
* The period of authorisation/certification is checked to ensure it is valid. Bona fide checks will be reconfirmed on an annual basis, in advance of the date they are due to expire. 
* All sources used to verify customer authorisations must be official sources such as Regulatory Authority or Health Board websites.

#### Establishing Bona Fide of Suppliers
* The following information is required :
  * Obtain a copy of the supplier’s current MIA/WDA/ASR or license (non-EU suppliers) granted by the relevant Regulatory Authority in which the product is manufactured/supplied from supplier.
  * A copy of the GMP and/or GDP certificate is obtained from the Supplier. If the certificate has expired the supplier is requested to provide information on whether there has been a recent audit by the Regulatory Authorities and if so the outcome of same and timing for expected issuance of approval.
  * Any documents provided must be authenticated and independently translated, as a minimum into English.
  * Verify the company name, scope, address and expiry of the Registration, GMP/GDP certificate, manufacturing/wholesale operation, authorised for the supplier site(s) on the Regulatory Authority’s official website. The operations that proposed suppliers are authorised to conduct must be verified (i.e. procure, holding, supply or export) as well as the category of medicinal products that may be supplied. If no official Authority database exists, the Quality Department should contact the national Regulatory Authority for assistance.
  * Check on the relevant Regulatory Authority database, e.g. for EU suppliers, EudraGMDP database, local Authority database, to determine if a GMP/GDP Non-Compliance Report has been issued for the supplier - reference section 7.4, or if the licence or authorisation has been revoked or suspended. 
* In the event that bona fide of the supplier cannot be confirmed, the Quality Department will contact the relevant local Regulatory Authority to ascertain the compliance risk and based on the outcome of a risk assessment as per Quality Risk Management, will determine whether approval of the supplier should be progressed.
* Due diligence checks are as per [Falsified Medicinal Products][VTOMR].

#### Establishing Bona Fide of Customers 
* When a customer is supplied products via a 4PL wholesale model the responsibility for performing the Bona Fide checks are performed by the 4PL wholesaler as detailed in the Quality Technical Agreement (QTA).
* The following information is required to be obtained when a customer is supplied products via a 3PL wholesale model:
  * For wholesalers, a copy of the customer’s current WDA and GDP certificate and those of the destination warehouse, if applicable, granted by the relevant Authority are obtained. The operations that proposed customer is authorised to conduct must be verified (i.e. procure, holding, supply or export) as well as the category of medicinal products that may be supplied.
  * Any documents provided must be authenticated wherever possible using the appropriate national register and independently translated where applicable.
  * The Regulatory Authority database is checked for registration, GDP certificate, WDA and has been issued for the customer site(s) e.g. the EU Member States database, EudraGMDP. Validity date of authorisation/certification is also checked.
  * A check if a Non-Compliant (NC) rating has been applied to the customer site is performed on the Regulatory Authority database e.g. EudraGMDP database is checked to determine if a GMP/GDP Non-Compliance Report has been issued for the customer-reference section 7.4
  * For customers who are authorised or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public such as General/Healthcare Practitioners or Pharmacist, verify they are authorised against the appropriate Medical Council registration or Pharmacist registration and that the ship to address is authorised to receive the category of medicinal products.
  * For hospitals or clinics with a pharmacy and retail pharmacies, verification via National Health Board or Medical Council/Pharmacy Registration Board may be performed as appropriate.
* In the event that bona fide of the customer cannot be confirmed, the Quality Department will contact the local Regulatory Authority/ National Health Board or Medical CounciI/Directory as appropriate for the customer in the market, to ascertain the compliance risk and based on the response and outcome of a risk assessment as per [Quality Risk Management][LBHIY], will determine whether approval of the customer should be progressed.

### Approval of supplier/customer Bona Fide
* The RP of the relevant entity reviews and approves the supplier or customer, when supplied via the 3PL wholesale model.
* The Inventory Management System is updated by Supply Chain and approved in the system by Quality.

### Annual Review of Bona Fides
* On at least an annual basis, the Quality Department requests approved customers and suppliers to provide a current copy of their bona fides documentation for review, authenticates the bona fides including Compliance Rating and records the outcome of the review.
* On at least an annual basis, the Quality Department requests the approved 4PL pre-wholesaler(s) approved customer list.
  * Verify the performance of the 4PL pre-wholesalers’ bona fide program by selecting a sample of the approved customers and requesting the relevant bona fide documents from the pre-wholesaler.
  * Independently verify the company name, scope, address and expiry of the Registration, GMP/GDP certificate, manufacturing/wholesale operation, authorised for the supplier site(s) on the Regulatory Authority’s official website. The operations that proposed suppliers are authorised to conduct must be verified (i.e. procure, holding, supply or export) as well as the category of medicinal products that may be supplied. If no official Authority database exists, the Quality Department should contact the national Regulatory Authority for assistance.
* If the supplier/customer bona fides documents have not been renewed/reissued during the preceding year, the Quality Department will review current bona fides on file and confirm the continued registration of the supplier or customer. In the event of cessation of authorisation/ certification/registration, the relevant entity RP will be contacted to determine next steps.

### Initial and Ongoing Non-Compliance check of suppliers and customers
* It does not use in any capacity any customer or supplier that has received an EU Statement of Non-Compliance, unless and until assessed and approved by the Director of Quality and the Responsible Person.
* Quality will verify compliance of customers and suppliers on at least monthly basis, unless otherwise dictated by local authority requirements. Links to registers are provided below:
  * EudraGDP: [http://eudragmpema.europa.eu/inspections/view/gdp/searchGDPNcr.xhtml?search=nonCompliance]

    * [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-terminated-and-cancelled-manufacturing-and-wholesale-dealer-licences]
* The reviewed registers, will be printed, dated and signed by Quality.
* In the event of a non-compliance rating that is deemed unsatisfactory, Quality may perform a risk assessment as per [Quality Risk Management][LBHIY], perform a for-cause audit of a supplier or contact the Regulatory Authority if deemed appropriate. Where it is determined that a supplier/customer no longer retains approval status or is to be removed from the Approved Register and Inventory Management System, a Change Control is raised in accordance with [Change Control][UYNEF].

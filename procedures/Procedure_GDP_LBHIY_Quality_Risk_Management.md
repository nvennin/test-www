## PROCEDURE

### Initiation of Risk Assessment

* Upon identification of requirement to conduct a Risk Assessment, a GitHub issue with the label 'RISK ASSESSMENT' is raised.
* Details of the scope of the Risk Assessment are logged in the issue.

### Risk Assessment

* Risk assessment consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards.
* As an aid to clearly defining the risk(s) for risk assessment purposes, three fundamental questions are often helpful:
  * What might go wrong?
  * What is the likelihood (probability) it will go wrong?
  * What are the consequences (severity)?
* The Risk Assessment, and subsequent analysis and evaluation, should be performed by a cross-functional team selected for their knowledge and experience of the subject.

### Risk Analysis and Evaluation

* Risk analysis is the estimation of the risk associated with the identified hazards and probability of detection.
* All data collected during the Risk Analysis and Evaluation should be appended to the RA issue to justify decisions whenever applicable. Include statistical approaches, trend analyses and data sets that are reliable and accessible.
* The analysis must conclude the likelihood of the event occurring, the severity of the impact should the event occur and probability that the current systems and measures in place will detect the risk should it occur.
* The Risk Priority Level is determined using Table 1 below.
* The output of the risk assessment is a qualitative description. The Risk Priority Level is High, Medium or Low.
* Where all Risk are deemed Low no further control measures are required to be identified.
* Where the Risk Priority Level is High or, the risk is deemed is unacceptable to the business, additional risk reduction measures are required to be identified.
* The complete Risk Assessment must be reviewed and approved by Quality

#### Table 1: Risk Categorisation

Risk Priority based on likelihood and severity.

|             | Low   | Medium  |   High  |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
|     **High**  | Low   | High     |  High   |
|     **Medium** | Low   | Medium    |   High   |
|     **Low**  | Low   | Low     |   Low   |

#### Risk Priority Rating

* High Risk Priority : further risk reduction measures are required.
* Medium Risk Priority : no action required; unless the risk remains unacceptable to the business where further risk reduction measures are required.
* Low Risk Priority : no action required.

### Risk Reduction

* All actions identified under the Risk Reduction Strategy and the details of each action to be implemented must be documented in a CAPA(s).
* The completed Risk Assessment is forwarded to Quality for approval by Head of Quality (or designated deputy). Quality will consider any further actions required for mediation of the risk and coordinate with the RA Initiator to implement further actions as required.
* The completed Risk Assessment is communicated to all impacted by the initial event, members of the RA team orthose identified under the confirmed CAPAs to implement mitigation actions.

### Re-Evaluation of High Priority Level Risk

* The above described process is repeated to establish the Risk Priority Rating in consideration of Risk Controls being introduced under the initial assessment.
* If the Risk Priority Rating remains High the issues must be escalated to the senior leadership team for consultation on next steps. The final outcome must be documented and appended to the RA Form, including justification for acceptance of risk if applicable.

### Completion of Risk Assessment

* The Risk Assessment is indicated as complete, and tracker updated, when the identified CAPAs have been approved and where required the re-evaluation is complete.

## PROCEDURE

### Management of Outsourced Activities

Outsourced GxP activites are subect to an approval process of providers:

1. **Risk assessment:** Risk Assessment of the outsourced activities to determine level of Qualification and Monitoring required.
2. **Qualification:** Assessment of the Third party Provider appropriate to the Risk Level.
3. **Approval:** Acceptance or Not of Third Party Provider for the specified outsourced activities including a mutual agreement.

Going forward, a **periodic review and monitoring** of the supplier shall be performed.

Change to outsourced GxP providers need to be managed through [Change Control][UYNEF].

### Risk assessment

A Risk Assessment is performed to establish the risks associated with the outsourced GXP activities.

### Qualification

* The level of effort and formality associated with Third Party Provider qualification should be directly proportional to the level of risk associated with the material or service.
* All third party providers that directly impacts the product quality or have an impact to GDP activities are to be audited as part of the initial qualification and should have Quality agreements in place. 
* Where a third party provider is required to store and handle controlled drugs and/or narcotics, they are to be audited in their licence and ability to do so, and that their staff have been appropriately trained.
* An audit can be performed through a questionnaire.
* Successful completion of the qualification step shall result in the Third Party Provider being identified as qualified.

### Approval

* Upon the Third party Provider being identified as Qualified, the RP will confirm the Provider as *approved*, *approved with corrective actions*, *pending corrective actions* or *rejected*. 
* The Change Control will be closed by Quality once all actions associated with the change are complete.

### Quality Agreements

* A Quality Agreement will be drawn up with the approved Third Party Provider which specifies their responsibilities about GDP activities and the communication process relating to the outsourced activities. 
* Where the storage and handling or controlled drugs and/or narcotics is required, this is to be included in the scope of the Quality Agreement.
* Changes associated with Third Party Provider will be undertaken in accordance with the procedure Change Management, or if changes are minor may form part of the scheduled periodic review and the Quality Technical Agreement will be revised accordingly.
* In some circumstances it may be possible to have an alternative to the Quality Agreement e.g. a Contract, Terms and Conditions or Scope of Work.

### Periodic Review and Monitoring

* Monitoring and reviewing of the Third Party Provider performance are detailed in the Quality Agreement.

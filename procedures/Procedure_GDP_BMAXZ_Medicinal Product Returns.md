## Roles

### Responsible Person (RP)

* Overall management of all aspects of Medicinal Product Returns
* Ensure any returned Medicinal Product is segregated and held in quarantine until an assessment of product Quality and integrity is performed
* Ensure the disposition of the returned Medicinal Product as saleable stock or sent for destruction
* Maintain an inventory of all returned Medicinal Product for reconciliation purposes

## Procedure 

### General
Any Medicinal Product that is subsequently returned back for non-quality related reasons is considered a Medicinal Product Return. Medicinal Product returns may include but are not
restricted to the following examples:
* The customer is supplied with the incorrect product that is subsequently returned
* A Medicinal Product which is received back to a distribution centre and have never been received by the customer
* A Medicinal Product which has been loaded onto the vehicle of the transportation carrier and is subsequently received back by the distribution centre

### Request for Medicinal Product Return
* All requests to return Medicinal Product will be made to the Customer Service Department.
* Customer Services Department will document the reason for return and inform the customer if they can accept a return. Returns for quality reasons cannot be accepted. Returns for commercial reasons are acceptable if they are as a result of a company error. If a return is requested due to a customer error, these cannot be accepted. Return of cold chain products, API or Exported products (ie. Products exported out of EEA control or returned into EEA) cannot be accepted. If acceptable, the Customer Services Department will authorise the Medicinal Product to be returned from Customer to Distribution Centre.
* Customer service will notify the customer that the defined Medicinal Product can be returned to the DC.
* The customer is responsible for the transportation of the Medicinal product per the Label Storage Conditions back to the DC. Alternatively, if the customer does not return the Medicinal product to the DCC they must provide evidence of destruction.

### Return of Medicinal Product to a Distribution Centre (DC)
* Any product returned to the Distribution Centre must be physically segregated so that there is no risk it could be returned to saleable stock in error.
* Only product in its original unopened shippers is eligible for return.
* A physical examination of this returned product must be performed by the Quality group at the Distribution Centre and documented according to their local procedure. The following information shall be recorded / provided by DC personnel :
   * Batch number: confirmation that this was the batch number shipped to this customer;
   * Quantity: this should match the packing list received with the product;
   * Product labelling: matches current product labelling;
   * Shipment condition: the returned product is in its original unopened shippers and is in good condition;
   * Shelf Life: the returned product has a minimum 12 months of shelf life remaining;
   * Label Storage Conditions: data to support the label storage conditions of the product should be provided e.g. Certificate of Storage or Temperature data from any associated data loggers;
   * Time since customer receipt: if the product is received back at the distribution centre within ten days of having been received by the customer, then the shipment may be assessed for acceptability to return to saleable stock. Where this time period is greater than ten days and the product is deemed suitable for return to saleable stock, a deviation must be raised and should include a risk assessment to support any decision deeming the stock suitable for consideration for return to saleable stock; and
   * Falsified Product: Confirm that there is no evidence to suggest that the product is illegitimate or suspect product. 
* All product which does not meet the above Distribution Centre inspection criteria will be deemed as non-saleable stock and will not be considered for return to saleable stock. All product deemed non—saleable must be placed into a reject area at the Distribution Centre. Such product is rejected by CA at the DC.

### Assessment of Product Returns
The documentation provided by the distribution centre will be reviewed. The Product Return Form will be completed as above :
* Verification the batch number is known for this product
* Check the Recall log to verify that the returned product is not from a recalled batch
* Approved Customer: check that product is being returned from an approved customer authorised to receive this product
* Verify that the return was for commercial reasons and not as a result of a customer complaint
* The product being returned must be within 12—month expiration date and must have a full chain of custody
* Confirm that there is no evidence to suggest that the product is falsified
* Verify that the customer returning the product has demonstrated that the returned products have been transported, stored and handled in compliance with its specific storage requirements per the product labelling
* Verify there is documented evidence and supportive data that the product has been stored under the registered storage conditions throughout the entire time the product was outside of the control of the DC
* The distributor has reasonable evidence that the product was supplied to the customer, via copies of the original delivery note or by referencing invoice numbers

### Disposition of Returned Medicinal Products
* Providing a copy of Product Return Form along with supporting documents to the relevant RP for approval or refusal that the returned product can be returned to saleable inventory at the distribution centre.
* The RP that has responsibility for the product on the market will disposition the returned product on Product Return Form as either 'Return to Saleable Stock’ or ’Reject'.
* Quality Department will forward the documented return decision (Accepted or Refused) to the DC. The DC will then update their system.
* If the Medicinal Product is to be returned to saleable stock, it should be returned by the distribution centre to stock such that a ”first expiry—first out' (FEFO) system is maintained. The inventory record must be updated, and a record kept.
* If the product is to be rejected, the product is transferred to the ’reject area’ by the distribution centre. The local RP/authorised delegate at the DC will arrange for a suitable, approved contract waste disposal provider, to collect and destroy the Medicinal Product. The DC maintains a copy of the destruction record and provides scanned copy to the company. 
* A report of inventory activities will be supplied by the Distributor/Local RP involved on a monthly basis which will include returns quantities. A reconciliation of this will be performed.This is to ensure that there are no discrepancies or risk of falsified medicines coming back into the system. Any issues identified will be notified to the RP, which has responsibility for the product on the market.
* Stolen products that have been recovered cannot be returned to saleable stock under any circumstances and must be stored in a segregated reject area awaiting final destruction.
* Any returned Medicinal Product suspected of being falsified will be managed in accordance with Procedure_GDP_VTOMR_Falsified Medicinal Products.

### Records of Returns Medicinal Product 
For each return of Medicinal Product, documentation should include:
* name and address of the consignee returning the product
* name or designation of product
* batch number and quantity returned
* reason for return
* use or disposal of the returned product and records of the assessment performed.

### Administration Site
Under no circumstances will any Medicinal Product be returned directly to the company or their administration sites. All Medicinal Product returned must be returned to the approved Distribution Centre from which they were dispatched.

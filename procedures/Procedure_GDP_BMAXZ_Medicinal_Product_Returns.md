## Roles

### Responsible Person (RP)

* Overall management of all aspects of Medicinal Product Returns
* Ensure any returned Medicinal Product is segregated and held in quarantine until an assessment of product Quality and integrity is performed
* Ensure the disposition of the returned Medicinal Product as saleable stock or sent for destruction
* Maintain an inventory of all returned Medicinal Product for reconciliation purposes

## Procedure 

### General

Any Medicinal Product that is subsequently returned back for non-quality related reasons is considered a Medicinal Product Return (or **Return**). Returns may include:

* The customer is supplied with the incorrect product that is subsequently returned
* A product received back to a distribution centre without having been received by the customer. For example, a product which has been loaded onto the vehicle of the transportation carrier and is subsequently received back by the distribution centre

### Request for Medicinal Product Return

* All requests for Return will be made to the Customer Service Department.
* Customer Services Department will document the reason for return and inform the customer if they can accept a return. Returns for quality reasons cannot be accepted. Return of exported products cannot be accepted. If acceptable, the Customer Services Department will authorise the Medicinal Product to be returned from Customer to Distribution Centre.
* Customer service will notify the customer that the defined Medicinal Product can be returned to the distribution center.
* The customer is responsible for the transportation of the Medicinal product per the Label Storage Conditions back to the distribution center. Alternatively, if the customer does not return the Medicinal product to the distribution center they must provide evidence of destruction.

### Return of Medicinal Product

* Any product returned to the distribution centre must be physically segregated so that there is no risk it could be returned to saleable stock in error.
* Only product in its original unopened shippers is eligible for return to saleable stock. For cold chain products, proof of suitable storage and transformation temperature is required in addition. 
* A physical examination of this returned product must be performed by the Quality group at the Distribution Centre and documented according to their local procedure. The following information shall be recorded:
  * *Batch number*: confirmation that this was the batch number shipped to this customer
  * *Quantity*: this should match the packing list received with the product
  * *Product labelling*: matches current product labelling;
  * *Shipment condition*: the returned product is in its original unopened shippers and is in good condition;
  * *Shelf Life*: the returned product has a minimum 12 months of shelf life remaining;
  * *Label Storage Conditions*: data to support the label storage conditions of the product should be provided e.g. Certificate of Storage or Temperature data from any associated data loggers;
  * *Falsified Product*: Confirm that there is no evidence to suggest that the product is illegitimate or suspect product, e.g., by scanning serialization codes

### Assessment of Product Returns

The documentation provided by the distribution centre will be reviewed by Quality and added to a newly created GitHub issue with the label 'PRODUCT RETURN'. The following information will be added to the issue:

* *Batch number*
  * Verification the batch number is known for this product
  * Verification that the returned product is not from a recalled batch
* *Authorized Customer*: Check that product is being returned from an approved customer
* *Commercial return*: Verify that the return was for commercial reasons and not quality reasons
* *Expiry Date*: The product being returned must be within 12—month expiration date
* *Falsified product*: Confirm that there is no evidence to suggest that the product is falsified
* *Storage requirements*: The returned products have been transported, stored and handled in compliance with its specific storage requirements per the product labelling
* *Delivery evidence*: The distributor has reasonable evidence that the product was supplied to the customer, via copies of the original delivery note or by referencing invoice numbers

### Disposition of Returned Medicinal Products

* The RP will disposition the returned product on Product Return issue as either 'Return to Saleable Stock’ or ’Reject'.
* Quality Department will forward the documented return decision (Accepted or Refused) to the distribution center. The distribution center will then update their system.
* If the Medicinal Product is to be returned to saleable stock, it should be returned by the distribution centre to stock such that a 'first expiry—first out' (FEFO) system is maintained. The inventory record must be updated, and a record kept.
* If the product is to be rejected, the product is transferred to the ’reject area’ by the distribution centre. The local RP/authorised delegate at the distribution center will arrange for a suitable, approved contract waste disposal provider, to collect and destroy the Medicinal Product. The distribution center maintains a copy of the destruction record and provides scanned copy to the company.
* Any returned Medicinal Product suspected of being falsified will be managed in accordance with Procedure_GDP_VTOMR_Falsified Medicinal Products.

### Administration Site

Under no circumstances will any Medicinal Product be returned directly to the company or their administration sites. All Medicinal Product returned must be returned to the approved Distribution Centre from which they were dispatched.

## PROCEDURE

### General Considerations

* Once a batch of a Medicinal Product is certified and made available for sale, any retrieval for a quality defect (e.g., non-conformance, safety or efficacy issue) from this point onwards must be considered a batch/product recall.
* All communications and correspondence regarding a product recall must be handled in an urgent and confidentia! manner.

### Quality Defect Identiﬁcation

Potential Quality Defects that may lead to a market action can be detected through the investigation and evaluation of but not limited to:
* Customer Complaints (either individual or from trend analyses).
* Adverse events (either individual or from trend analyses).
* Manufacturing deviations (where the impact assessment implicates previously released lots).
* Failures or trends indicating a likely failure, arising from the stability program.
* Direct Regulatory Agency Action (i.e. requests from the market competent authority or the manufacturer’s Supervisory Authority).
* Shipping/Distribution deviations (where the impact assessment implicates previously shipped/dislributed lots).
* Reports or evidence of the presence of Falsified and/or counterfeit product in the supply chain.
All such events must be documented and investigated as per [Deviations][XCEUG].

### Quality Defect Assessment

* Upon notification to the company, all potential Quality Defects are assessed by the Quality Department for potential impact on marketed product. if the company is not the MAH for the product in question, the Head of Quality notifies the relevant Head of Quality at the MAH.
* If the Quality review concludes 3 potential impact on Marketed Product it must be escalated to the Head of Quality and the Safety Monitoring Committee. The Head of Quality or delegate will notify the relevant Responsible Person for the market(s) in question.

### Assigning Recall Tracking Number

* The Quality Department assigns a tracking number as per the below indicated nomenclature. Details of the potential recall are recorded on the Medicinal Product Recalls tracker.
* The potential recall is assigned a tracking number in the format RECyy/xxx where: REC signifies recall, yy signifies the year and xxx is a sequential number starting at 001.
 
### Investigation

* The Quality Department will perform an investigation and liaise with the appropriate external parties to determine the most probable root cause of the Quality Defect in a timely manner to allow an assessment to be made of the extent of the Defect in marketed or distributed product. 

### Inventory Assessment

* The Quality Department works with the Supply Chain Department to determine the quantity of distributed and undistributed stock.
* If product or materials identified as potentially impacted by the Quality Defect remain in the control of the company directly or with suppliers, the Quality Department sends a written request to instruct that the materials be placed on hold and requests confirmation that the products have been blocked.

### Health Hazard Evaluation

* To characterise a Quality Defect correctly in terms of risk to the patient, a documented Health Hazard Evaluation is requested from the Safety Monitoring Committee as required. To save time, a verbal request may be made initially to the QPPV (who is a key member of the Safety Monitoring Committee), followed up with written confirmation. The Safety Monitoring Committee ensures a timely provision of the requested Health Hazard Evaluation.
* Quality Defects are classified based on patient risk as follows:


|Risk Category                                                                                                                                                | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|                
|**Class I** - Product quality defects with the potential to be life threatening or that could cause serious risk to health                                   |
|**Class II** - Product quality defects with the potential to cause illness or mistreatment but are of lower risk than Class 1                                |
|**Class III** - Product quality defects which are not likely to pose a significant hazard to health but where a recall has been initiated for other reasons  | 

### Quality Defect Notification
 
* The Head of Quality/authorised delegate at MAH makes initial contact with the Regulatory Authorities in relation to any potential product recall situation. Local responsible persons are involved as required by local legislation.

### Market Action Decisions and Strategies

A Recall Review meeting is called by the Head of Quality or authorised delegate as quickly as possible. This meeting includes key stakeholders to review the critical information with respect to:
* Nature and root cause of the Quality Defect.
* Quality Impact Assessment (including distribution and status of potentially impacted materials).
* Health Hazard Evaluation.
* Applicable regulations.
* Potential impact on patients (supply shortages, alternative treatments etc).

The meeting attendees include, but are not limited to:
* Head of Quality
* Qualified Person relevant to product(s)
* Responsible Person relevant to market(s)
* Global Head of Supply Chain
* Head of PV
* Chief Medical Officer

However, the participation of all attendees at the Potential Recall Review Meeting may be limited due to participant unavailability to ensure timely review of data. Required meeting attendees may send authorised delegates if required.

The following are determined where possible:
* The root cause of the Quality Defect has been sufficiently characterised to allow an accurate assessment of the extent of the impact on identified and other related batches.
* The severity of the defect in terms of product safety, efficacy, quality and compliance is sufficiently understood to support the following decisions:
  * Whether a Market Action is required.
  * Classification of the risk to the patient.
  * Recommended extent of any market action.
* Whether there are additional factors that must be considered as part of the communication with Competent Authorities which may modify the level of any recommended market action such as:
  * Medical significance of the product.
  * Availability of competitor products containing the same generic active ingredients or therapeutic equivalents.

The proceedings of the Recall Meeting are documented and form part of the formal record.

Based on the input of participants, discussions with regulatory authority(ies) and review of data at the recall review meeting, the Head of Quality recommends whether the Recall is to be initiated and whether this is required to be an urgent request.

The Head of Quality informs the Safety Monitoring Committee on outcome of the meeting and any necessary Market Action to be taken including all recalls.

### Regulatory Authority Notiﬁcation
 
The company and the Regulator will agree the immediate and longer-term actions to be taken.

These actions include:
* Classification and extent of recall (if required)
* Method of notification of the recall and timelines for carrying out and completing the recall
* Method of recall effectiveness checking
* Required actions for non-responders
* Notification of other Regulatory Authorities
 
Notiﬁcations to local Regulatory Authorities are by local Regulatory Representatives in the country(ies) in question if possible, or other arrangements may be made as appropriate. For centrally authorized Medicinal Products, the EMA must be notified using their Defective product report template. The Theramex Head of Quality / authorized delegate must oversee the content of such notifications and communications and ensure all agencies are kept informed.

In agreement with the Regulatory Authorities, for serious Recalls and/or situations where there may be a need to issue a press release in order to caution healthcare professionals and the public, the content of the press release and the process for handling public queries are agreed with the Regulatory Authority and the legal team as appropriate.

Regulatory authorities may also advise that a Caution—in-Use Notification is issued to healthcare professionals if necessary, even if a product recall is not merited.

The format, content, and extent of any recall communication shall be commensurate with the recall classification of the product being recalled and the strategy developed for that recall.

The purpose of a product recall communication is to convey information to the relevant parties (who may be partner companies, Affiliate offices, distributors/wholesalers, medical personnel, pharmacists and/or customers). All materials which are discussed in the recall communication must be identified by formal name, batch number, or other identity information as applicable, for example:
* That the product in question is subject to a recall and the reason.
* That further distribution and/or use of remaining product must cease immediately, if appropriate.
* Instructions regarding what to do with the product.

A recall communication is prepared by Quality (together with the Safety Monitoring Committee in case of safety issues) or authorised delegate and approved by the Regulatory Authority, along with the Head of Quality. Reference HPRA Guide for Recall of Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use for sample batch recall letters and sample caution-in-use letter.

Once the recall classification and strategy are agreed with the Regulator the recall commences whereby the company organises notification to customers affected by the product recall and determine the extent and location of recalled product manufactured, stored, procured, distributed and under distribution including promotional samples as applicable.

With the support of the Supply Chain department, Quality or authorised delegate oversees that product for recall is tracked, segregated, returned (or disposed if agreed), and reconciled and through this oversight ensures recall effectiveness.
 
Recalled product is held at the authorised distribution warehouse until termination of the recall investigation has been agreed by regulatory authorities.

Quality / authorized delegate prepares periodic recall status reports. It is the responsibility of Quality to keep the Regulatory Authority abreast of the progress of actions which are agreed to support a product recall process.

Recall status reports are discontinued when it is agreed by the Regulator that the recall is terminated.

### Termination of a Recall

* A recall may only be terminated upon issuance of written confirmation by the appropriate Regulatory Authority. Quality may request the termination of a recall by submitting a written request to the Regulatory Authority.
* A final recall status report is prepared by Quality / authorised delegate, as appropriate, for submission to the Regulatory Authority(ies) within the agreed timeline.
* The Recall Report Form is approved by Quality after the investigation is completed and adequate CAPAs are identified, with any immediate actions required completed. The effectiveness of such actions must be verified as appropriate.
* The company is responsible for the destruction of the recalled product. Recalled product shall not be destroyed without prior written authorisation from Head of Quality / authorised delegate as appropriate and following agreement by the Regulator of termination of the recall. Reconciliation and destruction certification to be completed/provided. 

### No Recall Action

* Where a decision is made by the company, in conjunction with the QP, RP, Safety Monitoring Committee, and relevant Regulatory Authority(ies), not to recall a product from the market, the justification for this decision must be documented.

### Effectiveness of Recall

* The effectiveness of the recall is detailed. The effectiveness check will summarise lessons learnt from the recall and reference any [CAPA][YUISV] raised to implement changes in the process to reflect these.

### Mock Recall

* A mock recall must be performed by the Quality Department or authorised delegate at least annually to test the recall procedure, unless a product recall has been executed in that timeframe.
* The mock recall should mimic that of a true recall, this procedure should be adhered to throughout the mock recall process and all documentation completed in line with the procedure. The mock recall will stop short of contacting customers, MA holder (if applicable) or the regulatory authority.
* Mock recall must cover at a minimum but not be limited to:
  * Verifying the accuracy of contact names and numbers.
  * Challenging the product traceability procedures.
  * Challenging the batch reconciliation details.
* Mock recall reports should include the following sections:
  1. Introduction
  2. Purpose
  3. Mock Recalt
    a. Back to the CMO
    b. Forward to the Marketplace
  4. Review of Distribution Records
  5. Verification of 24 Hour Contact Details
  6. Conclusion
* Stock is not physically returned during this mock recall. 
* An effectiveness check is made by the Quality Department or authorised delegate after the mock recall, to establish how quickly and efficiently this was carried out
* Quality prepares a final report to highlight any issues that were encountered during the mock recall. Appropriate corrective or preventative actions are defined as necessary as a continuous improvement of the system. The report is approved by Head of Quality, RPs and Pharmacien Reponsable.

### Storage of Records
 
* All actual or mock recall records are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.

## PROCEDURE

### What Needs to be Reported

All permanent and outsourced staff have to forward any AE, special case scenario, PQC or MIE which comes to their attention to the appropriate point of contact.
In case of doubt, whether something qualifies as an AE, special case scenario, PQC or not, always report to the appropriate point of contact.

### Sources of Reports
AEs, special case scenarios and PQCs might arise from the following sources, but are not limited to such sources:
* Spontaneous reports from HCPs, patients and their relatives, consumers and authorities
* Literature e.g. relevant scientific literature (global & local), abstracts or poster from meetings
* During receipt of a MIE
* Internet and digital media
* Company-sponsored / supported websites
* Authority websites
* Solicited reports from e.g. clinical studies
* Company sponsored market research programs
* Or any other source e.g. lay press or other media

### What to report
* At least the following data needs to be requested:
  * The date when the employee or contractor became aware of the event (Day 0)
  * Identifiable Reporter (e.g. Name, contact data)
  * Identiﬁable Patient (e.g. initials, gender, birth date, age group, gestation period, medical record number)
  * Medicinal drug (e.g. tradename, dose, application form)
  * Batch number and expiry date 
  * Adverse Event (symptom(s), diagnosis) or complaint description (in the reporter’s own words if report received directly)
  * Try to collect as much information as possible e.g. indication for use, medical history and concomitant drugs
  * Availability of complaint sample or photos of same
* If any of the information above cannot be collected (for example some information is not available, or the patient/HCP doesn’t wish to provide their contact information, etc.), this should be noted by indicating that the required information is ”Unknown" (if the reporter cannot recall or ﬁnd the information) or ”Refused”.
* No comments, judgement or assessment of the information should be made (e.g. regarding the seriousness of the AE/PQC or whether the AE/PQC was caused by a Medicinal Product).
* All reports (even if incomplete} must be forwarded regardless of the seriousness of the event whether ot there is a causal relationship with the product and whether or not the event is mentioned in the Medicinal Product label.
* Also incomplete information, where only the medicinal product and the AE, special case scenario or PQC is known, should be forwarded as appropriate.
* In case of doubt, always report to the appropriate point of contact.
